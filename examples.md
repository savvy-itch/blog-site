I have explored various programming languages during my journey as a developer. Each has its strengths and use cases, but these are the ones I enjoy the most:


- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Perfect for web development and creating dynamic applications.
- **Python**: Great for scripting, automation, and back-end development.
- **Dart**: My go-to for building cross-platform mobile applications with Flutter.


``` { .code-block .formatted-code }
# Python example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

``` { .cs .code-block .formatted-code }
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string greeting = "Hello, C#!";
        Console.WriteLine(greeting);
    }
}
```

Python and JavaScript are two of the most popular programming languages today. Both serve different purposes, yet they share some similarities. Here's a quick comparison of the two:

| Feature             | Python                          | JavaScript                    |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Use         | Back-end development, data analysis, AI/ML | Front-end and full-stack web development |
| Syntax              | Easy to read and write         | Flexible, but can be quirky   |
| Execution           | Interpreted                    | Interpreted (or JIT compiled) |




- **Object-Oriented Design**: C# follows a robust object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, making it easy to organize and manage code.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: With .NET, C# enables developers to create applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Gaming Development**: C# is the language of choice for Unity, one of the most popular game development platforms.
